    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of
	<a href='https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781732'>DS 4200 F20: Information Visualization</a>,
	taught by <a href='https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/'>Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,

    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>This project is about the relationship between economic behavior, education,
      and outcomes, and particularly their relation to environmental concern. The
      idea that people should become more aware of environmental issues is not
      sufficient; we need pro-environmental action. We are particularly interested
      in what kind of information impacts people's perceptions of their actions,
      and the the trigger points that make people act on their knowledge and
      awareness. Our partner is a research team at Northeastern led by economics
      professor Dr. Venkatesan. The data used in this project is from a survey
      conducted by Dr. Venkatesan and a group of students.</p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>You can interact with the public dataset graphs by highlighting either points on the line graph or rows in the table.
    The corresponding data points in the other graph will be highlighted as well. <br>
    <br>
    You can interact with the Northeastern University survey result graphs by hovering over the pie chart sections or bars to get
    details on the precise values in the dataset.

  <h5> Data on Plastics in Municpal Solid Waste (MSW) by Weight (in thousands of U.S. tons) </h5>
  <p>In 2018, only around 8.5% of plastics produced were recycled. A majority of these plastics ended up in landfills.</p> <br>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>Link presentation slides!<br>
    <br>
      Our visualization looks at public reycling data and recycling/enviornmental action data
      gained from a survey. The visualization shows that only around 8.5% of plastics were recycled in 2018.
      Many survey respondents recycle and think that the percentage of recycled items is much higher
      than the actual percentage. We look at the relationship between recycling habits and the perception
      of the problem of climate change. Additionally, we relate this to the action element of willingness
      to pay additional money to eliminate enviornmental damage of single-use cups.
