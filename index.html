    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>This project is about the relationship between economic behavior, education, and outcomes,
      and particularly their relation to environmental concern. The idea that people should become
      more aware of environmental issues is not enough; we need pro-environmental action.
      We are particularly interested in what kind of information impacts people's perceptions
      of their actions, and the trigger points that make people act on their knowledge and awareness.
      In this project, we compare survey respondents' recycling perceptions to actual recycling data
      from public data sets. We also look at how people's recycling actions relate to their overall
      environmental concern, as well as willingness to participate in other positive environmental
      action. Our partner is a research team at Northeastern led by economics professor Dr. Venkatesan.
      The data used in this project is from a survey conducted by Dr. Venkatesan and a group
      of Northeastern students.</p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>You can interact with the public dataset graphs by highlighting either points on the line graph or rows in the table.
    The corresponding data points in the other graph will be highlighted as well. <br>
    <br>
    You can interact with the Northeastern University survey result graphs by hovering over the pie chart sections or bars to get
    details on the precise values in the dataset.

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p> Public Data Visualizations: <br>
    <br>
    For our public data visualizations, we chose to include a line
    graph and a table with correlating data for the viewer to visualize
    how much waste has been recycled over time. For the first visualization, it is a line graph depicting the percentages of waste recycled
    over time. The data we used here was parsed from the existing
    public data set, using a simple division calculation for ease of understanding for the audience. We chose a line graph because they best
    depict trends over time, which is the most important factor for this
    visualization. The line graph also changes in size depending on the
    size of the browser, so that it is always easily readable no matter the
    dimensions. When viewing the line graph, there are several points
    that are shown as small circles, which are the exact data points used
    to construct the graph. These circles can then be selected by the user
    to see the corresponding data in the adjacent table (more information
    below). The encodings we used were the y-coordinate of a point as
    a representation of the percentage, and the progression of the x-axis
    as the change in time.<br>

    <br> The second visualization pertaining to the public data set was a
    table showing all of the values given from this data set, including
    the year, how much waste was generated and recycled, and the percentage of recycled waste. The table provides clarity to the audience
    on the exact number of tons that were generated and recycled, and
    can provide context for the line graph right beside it. Users can
    also analyze and link the data from the line graph to the table using
    brushing and linking, where if the user clicks and drags, they can
    create a box that will match data from the table to the line graph, or
    vice versa. This method makes it easy for users to draw analyses
    based on the information from the line graph and the table with the
    public data, as well as understanding which data points are linked to
    each other.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    Northeastern University Survey Results Visualizations:<br>
    <br>
    To visualize the Northeastern survey results, we used a series
    of pie charts and stacked bar charts. The data is mostly qualitative
    and proportions matter, so these graphs satisfy both of these data
    elements. We kept the color encoding consistent across the visualizations, with the light red/pink color denoting not recycling and the
    light green meaning not recycling. We used light colors colors so saturation isnâ€™t too high and the text is easy to read. We kept the colors
    consistent across graphs because they represent the same attribute.
    We made these specific color decisions because of the general association of red meaning stop/no and green meaning go/yes, but also
    because green has an association with positive environmental action.<br>

    <br>In each graph, the user hover over the pie chart sections or bar
    chart sections to see more detail. The more precise values associated
    with that section will show to provide more information. The user
    can compare how answers to the questions change based on whether
    or not the respondent routinely recycles, and also look at overall
    sentiment toward the questions.<br>
